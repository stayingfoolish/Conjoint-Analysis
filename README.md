# Conjoint-Analysis

It means consider jointly, It is a marketing insight technique which provides consumers with combinations or pairs or groups of products that are combination of various features and ask them what they prefer,here the product is described by number of attributes, each attribute has a number of levels. The current example is an example of full profile studies which is ideal for small set of attributes around 4 to 5. One of the most important strengths of Conjoint Analysis is the ability to develop market simulation models that can predict consumer behavior to product changes. Because conjoint analysis helps you understand your market’s preferences, you can apply it to a variety of difficult aspects of the job, including product development, competitive positioning, pricing, product line analysis, segmentation and resource allocation.
A full profile 
Steps in Conjoint Study Analysis:
1.Identify the problem and define the attributes ,  all product features should be displayed or only those most relevant to differentiating a product from competitive offerings.
2. Develop the study protocol including all contact, sampling and follow-up protocols. Also develop the survey and associated visual aids, products, graphics, etc. that are to be used.
 3. Develop the questionnaire... and then pretest the survey and data collection activity. Evaluate the process and revise until you are satisfied with the approach, instrument and the methodology. 4. Using one of a variety of data collection procedures described below, collect the data.
 5. Process the data to derive at the individual respondent level estimates of the part-worths of each person’s utility function.
 6. Segmentation Analysis: The matrix of respondent by attribute-level part-worths may then be related to other subject background data in an effort to identify possible market segments based on similarities in part-worth functions.

Full-profile conjoint analysis is the most fundamental approach for measuring attribute utilities. In the full-profile conjoint task, different product descriptions are developed and presented to the consumer for preference evaluations by ranking them. Each product profile is designed as part of a full factorial, or fractional factorial experimental design that evenly matches the occurrence of each attribute with all other attributes. By controlling the attribute pairings in a fractional factorial design, the researcher can estimate the respondent’s utility for each level of each attribute tested using a reduced set of profiles.


The following conjoint example focuses on the evaluation of advertising appeal for allergy medication. The medication is described by 4 attributes that describe part of the Bike to be introduced in the market: gear, type of bike, whether suspension is present or not , and guards. Each attribute has 2 levels.
The data analysis, once completed can be averaged over all respondents to show the average utility level for each level of each attribute, and graphed to show trends over the levels.

The final stage in this full profile conjoint analysis is the preparation of estimates of choice share using a market simulator. For a given concept profile that is defined by a level for each of the four attributes, the respondent’s two utility scores (for the respective levels) are added together.
