Conjoint analysis:
What is Conjoint analysis? When do we do full profile conjoint analysis?
It means consider jointly, It is a marketing insight technique which provides consumers with combinations or pairs or groups of products that are combination of various features and ask them what they prefer, here the product is described by number of attributes, each attribute has a number of levels. The current example is an example of full profile studies which is ideal for small set of attributes around 4 to 5. One of the most important strengths of Conjoint Analysis is the ability to develop market simulation models that can predict consumer behavior to product changes. Because conjoint analysis helps you understand your market’s preferences, you can apply it to a variety of difficult aspects of the job, including product development, competitive positioning, pricing, product line analysis, segmentation and resource allocation.

What is full profile conjoint analysis?
Full-profile conjoint analysis is the most fundamental approach for measuring attribute utilities. In the full-profile conjoint task, different product descriptions are developed and presented to the consumer for preference evaluations by ranking them. Each product profile is designed as part of a full factorial, or fractional factorial experimental design that evenly matches the occurrence of each attribute with all other attributes. By controlling the attribute pairings in a fractional factorial design, the researcher can estimate the respondent’s utility for each level of each attribute tested using a reduced set of profiles.

What is Part worth’s?
It is overall preference by consumer on each level of each attribute of the product.

What Is relative importance?
Relative importance is how much each attribute can make a difference in total utility of the product.

What are utilities?
A individual’s subjective preference judgement representing the holistic value or worth of object. 

The following conjoint example focuses on the evaluation of market research for a new bike. The simulated data set is described by 4 attributes that describe part of the Bike to be introduced in the market: gear, type of bike, whether suspension is hard or soft tail, closed and open mud guards. Each attribute has 2 levels. The data analysis, once completed can be averaged over all respondents to show the average utility level for each level of each attribute, and graphed to show trends over the levels.
The final stage in this full profile conjoint analysis is the preparation of estimates of choice share using a market simulator. For a given concept profile that is defined by a level for each of the four attributes, we use a first choice based model also known as the Maximum Utility Model which assumes that each subject will buy the product for which he or she has the maximum utility with probability of 1 and Logit Model which assumes that the probability of a subject purchasing a product is a logit function of utility show in the code below.
